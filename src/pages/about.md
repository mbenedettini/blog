# Mariano Benedettini

I'm a seasoned Software Engineer based in Argentina with a career spanning over 15 years in the tech industry. My journey has taken me from small startups to Fortune 500 companies, giving me a unique perspective on software development and team management.

## Professional Experience

Throughout my career, I've worn many hats with the latest being:

- As a Platform Engineer at Span, I worked on splitting databases, migrating to EKS clusters, and optimizing infrastructure spending.
- As an Engineering Manager at Compass, I led teams closely related to Glide and grew the Argentina-based team from 10 to 30+ people.
- At Glide, I managed the development of their Android app from scratch and led the implementation of data privacy policies for CCPA compliance.

My technical expertise includes Python, NodeJS, TypeScript, and various cloud technologies. I'm particularly skilled in Infra/Platform Engineering, but my T-shaped skill set allows me to contribute across different areas of software development.
